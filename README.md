# Indicia Client Helpers Library

The client_helpers library provides functions useful for websites that 
interact with an [Indicia warehouse](1).

The library is used by the warehouse itself and also in the modules
that add Indicia features to Drupal websites.
* [Drupal 8 module](2) 
* [Drupal 7 module](3)

It is not limited to any PHP framework though.
