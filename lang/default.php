$default_terms['import_settings_instructions'] = <<<TEXT
Before proceeding with the import, please specify the following settings that will apply to every record in the import
file. Any settings that you do not specify here can be supplied in the import file on a row by row basis by mapping the
setting to the appropriate column in the next step.
TEXT;
$default_terms['column_mapping_instructions'] = <<<TEXT
Please map each column in the CSV file you are uploading to the associated attribute in the database. We've tried to
match your columns to the available attributes where possible so check any automatically selected attributes in the
<strong>Maps to attribute</strong> column before proceeding. If you plan to repeat imports from similar spreadsheets in
future you can use the tickboxes to remember your choices.
TEXT;
$default_terms['partial_commits_download_error_file_instructions'] = <<<TEXT
As part of your upload was unsuccessful, download the generated CSV file which holds the rows of data that did not
upload. Find the column called "Problem" which lists the associated error for each row. Correct the error, and then
re-upload the CSV file containing <strong>only</strong> the rows of data which did not upload correctly. Please do not
re-upload the whole dataset again.
TEXT;
$default_terms['no_commits_download_error_file_instructions'] = <<<TEXT
'Problems have been found in your upload file. Please download the generated CSV file 
 which holds the rows of data that did not upload and find the column called "Problem" which lists the associated 
 error for each row. Once you have corrected all the errors in the <strong>original file</strong>, please re-upload the original file again. 
 No rows will be uploaded to the database until all errors have been corrected.
TEXT;

$default_terms['gps_precision_instructions'] = <<<TEXT
This is the precision (normally given as a radius in metres) reported by most GPS devices or phones. This field is
only enabled for 10-figure OS grid references. These represent 1 m accuracy, however, this is normally associated with
some degree of error, which is the GPS precision recorded here. Precise grid references reported to a lower accuracy
than 10-figures are assumed to represent the corresponding OS square (e.g. a 100 m or 10 m square), and so additional
precision information is not required.
